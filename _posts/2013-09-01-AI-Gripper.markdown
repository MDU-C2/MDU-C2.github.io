description: The human hand is a highly advanced structure, both in terms of sensory capabilities and mechanical functions. It is able to grasp objects with great precision and strength through the use of its 29 joints and 34 muscles. Constructing a robotic hand that can replicate the movements and sensory capabilities of the human hand would be a complex and challenging task. In everyday life, the human hand relies on visual information to locate and identify objects, as well as to determine their weight and material properties in order to prepare for a grasp. Through trial and error, humans have developed the ability to grasp objects with a wide range of characteristics and adapt their grasping techniques accordingly. As robots become more prevalent in our daily lives, it becomes increasingly important for them to be able to handle a diverse range of objects in unstructured environments, unlike earlier industrial robots which were designed to handle specific objects in controlled settings. An optimal design for a gripper in this context would be one that can work independently, without the need for any external sensors or vision systems. All computations would be performed internally, and all information about the object to be grasped would be gathered from sensors integrated into the gripper itself. To achieve this, the gripper would need to be equipped with a variety of sensors, including visual sensors to enable it to adapt its grasp to the object, as well as force control sensors to allow it to grasp objects without damaging them. Careful selection and placement of these sensors would enable the gripper to grasp unknown objects without the need for external systems.
