description: Microwave Tomography (MWT) is a technique that uses microwaves to create cross-sectional images for biomedical imaging. MWT has the potential to be used in conjunction with mammography for both detection and monitoring during treatment. Previous research has focused on improving various aspects of microwave imaging. The aim of this project is to improve the accuracy of transmitter placement on the object being scanned, in order to improve the quality of the scan.
